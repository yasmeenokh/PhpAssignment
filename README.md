## Language : Php 

## Both Functions will be found in the main file, I added some unit test to test the functions using phpUnit. 

### First Function: is a sort function that takes an array of number of length 10 as a parameter, and returned a sorted array.

### Second Function : is a validation function to a certain string, that takes a srting as a parameter and returns true or false 
according to wether the string matches the specified pattern or not , which i have used regex for.
